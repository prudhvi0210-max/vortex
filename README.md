# Quantum Brush Extensions: Quantum Vortex & Entanglement Effects

This repository builds on the Quantum Brush project by adding two new hybrid
quantum–classical visual effects:

- Quantum Vortex — quantum-driven swirl distortion along brush strokes
- Entanglement Effect— quantum-entangled color and brightness modulation across strokes

The full Quantum Brush codebase is included because both effects reuse existing
utilities, data structures, and dependencies. No core Quantum Brush files are
modified; new effects are integrated alongside existing ones following the
standard project structure.

##  Quantum Vortex

### Overview
Quantum Vortex is a hybrid quantum–classical image distortion effect that applies
localized vortex swirls along a user-drawn stroke path. Each stroke segment becomes
an independent vortex whose rotation angle is generated by a quantum circuit.

### Description
- Stroke paths are split into multiple segments using user click points.
- Each segment is assigned a quantum-generated rotation angle.
- A classical polar-coordinate remapping applies a swirl around the segment center.
- The swirl strength is strongest near the stroke center and smoothly fades outward.

### Refinement History
Early vortex implementations produced mostly linear translation effects due to:
- global scaling dilution
- insufficient angular amplification

Later refinements introduced:
- localized radial normalization
- boosted angular multipliers

These changes transformed the effect into a true rotational vortex, producing
clear circular motion and visually coherent swirling distortions.

 Entanglement Effect

 Overview
The Entanglement effect introduces **quantum correlations between multiple stroke
segments**, modifying color hue and brightness based on entangled quantum states.

 Description
- Each stroke segment is represented by a qubit.
- Initial qubit states are derived from the average hue and lightness of the stroke region.
- Qubits are entangled using controlled quantum rotations.
- Quantum measurements produce new angular parameters.
- These parameters are mapped back to color and brightness shifts in the image.

This effect emphasizes structured correlation rather than randomness, allowing
different stroke segments to influence each other visually.

## How It Works

### 1. Stroke Segmentation
User click points divide a brush stroke into multiple independent segments.
Each segment is processed separately but may be quantum-correlated.

### 2. Quantum State Preparation
For each segment:
- Hue is mapped to an azimuthal angle (φ)
- Lightness is mapped to a polar angle (θ)
These values initialize qubit rotations.

### 3. Quantum Entanglement
- Qubits are entangled pairwise using controlled rotations.
- Entanglement strength is controlled by a user-defined parameter.

### 4. Measurement & Parameter Extraction
Expectation values of Pauli X, Y, and Z operators are measured.
These values are converted back into updated (φ, θ) angles.

### 5. Classical Image Mapping
- For Quantum Vortex: angles control pixel rotation in polar coordinates.
- For Entanglement: angle differences control hue and brightness shifts.
- Only pixels within a local radius around each stroke segment are modified.

 Intended Use

These effects are designed for:

- Generative and creative image processing
- Experimental visual tools
- Quantum-inspired artistic workflows
- Educational demonstrations of hybrid quantum–classical systems


  Notes

- Quantum Vortex emphasizes quantum randomness
- Entanglement Effect emphasizes quantum correlation
- Neither effect processes pixels directly with quantum hardware
- Quantum circuits generate control parameters used by classical image transforms
