# Welcome to the creative side of quantum computing!
**[Quantum Brush](https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush)** is the Java (`OpenJDK 21+`) application which contains creative digital pixel/colour/selection modification algorithms powered by quantum computing. This lightweight programme supports various visual quantum algorithms with local simulation, which is good for future quantum art enthusiasts and Python developers so that they can try to make their own quantum brushes. Now is your chance.
If you want to read the paper before you go, the preprint is [here](https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush).

## Why: Motivation and brief introduction
MOTH aims to demonstrate how quantum technology can support creative industries even nowadays in the NISQ-era, while actively building its use cases. History proved art, science and technology evolves together, whilst each introduces new, unique viewpoints onto 'the new world'. While we are moving onto the FTQC-era, we can still explore the creative side of quantum technology, setting up quantum algorithm for quantum emulation and hardware, so that in the future, these will be advanced into unimaginable, exciting new era of computation.

## How: Description
Quantum Brush is one of the example. It is a collection/application of digital brushes. The app itself is written with Java and there is a backend operated by Python, where you will mostly contribute with your own brush. The communication between the app (Java) and the brush (Python) is conducted with JSON documents. All templates are in the Quantum Brush [repository](https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush) and you can read through `README.md` there.
There is a Jupyter Notebook tutorial where you can get a glimpse of how the brushes work, how you can setup the JSON document, and how data structure will work. It is created on Google CoLab and here is the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_guH4IbEmCFA3bPTWEVa8jI_d1-TP63V?usp=sharing).
Based on the template and the tutorial, you can make your own brush, `brushName.py` with its following requirements, `brushName_requirements.json`, underneath the folder `brushName`. Position it underneath the `effect` folder in `$HOME/QuantumBrush`, and test it out on the application.
To install the application, go [here](https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush) and download `install.sh` underneath the Releases tab. And follow the instructions on the another `README.md` there.

## What: Goals
1. Make your own Quantum Brush
2. (Bonus!) Improve UI/UX of the Quantum Brush application: Now, Quantum Brush is in the stage of private distribution for clients and internal usage. We want to take this further in the future. Beforehand, can you help us with tidying up the UI/UX so the onboarding process can be smoother? 

## Who: Eligibility and license
**Anyone** who heard of quantum art, has an interest in creative computing, actively researches quantum algorithms, wants to improve their skills while contributing to open-source software is all welcomed. Basic knowledge of version control (Git), logic management between different computer languages (Java, Python), user experience, are required. Or you can build up these skills with learning-by-doing!
Participants who are selected as a winner will become an official contributor on Quantum Brush's GitHub repository, with your GitHub handle and profile picture on it.
The license follows APACHE license 2.0, the permissive open source license. You can do something you want to do with the software, if you:
- Include the original copyright and license notice, and
- State all changes/contributions, and
- Include the NOTICE file if needed.
If you require further information or have any questions, book a session with one of the creators of Quantum Brush, Astryd Park.
